## Development Environment Setup
CinemaMod requires a build of Java Chromium Embedded Framework to work - it uses the embedded browser in-game to render the videos. The java-cef builds are large binaries and are not included in this repo. I host builds of java-cef specifically for use with this mod on [my cloud storage](https://ewr1.vultrobjects.com/cinemamod-libraries/). When a release is made, .jars are created for each platform that contain the java-cef binaries. I.e. there is a .jar for Windows, Mac, Linux; the .jars will only work on their respective platform.

During development, it is necessary to have a build of java-cef for the mod to work properly. There is a gradle task to download the java-cef binaries into your gradle `build` directory.

First, clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/CinemaMod/CinemaMod-Fabric
$ cd CinemaMod-Fabric
```

Then, clone the java-cef submodule (brings in the java-cef code)
```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Finally, download the java-cef builds (this may take a while)
```
$ ./gradlew downloadJcef
```

You should be able to edit the code and run the client from here, try
```
$ ./gradlew runClient
```

# CinemaMod-Bukkit
Watch online videos with others in Minecraft. This is the server implementation for Bukkit. Supports CinemaMod-Fabric users while also allowing you to use your average Bukkit server (Spigot, Paper, etc). Vanilla clients are still able to join, just not see the cinema screens.

NOT RELEASED, IN DEVELOPMENT

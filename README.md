# CinemaMod
Watch online videos with others in Minecraft.

NOT RELEASED, IN DEVELOPMENT. If you use this, understand that there are bugs and it is not complete.

Current blockers before releasing:
- Need to convert CinemaMod to use MCEF 2
- Need to make a server backend for Fabric in addition to Bukkit
- Need to remove the hard requirement for ffmpeg to be installed on the server
